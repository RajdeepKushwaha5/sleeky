  about: `
## Hey there! I'm Rajdeep 👋

I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** and **Blockchain Developer** who loves turning complex problems into elegant, user-friendly solutions.

### What I Do

→ **Build Modern Web Apps** — From responsive frontends to robust backends, I craft seamless digital experiences using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

→ **Explore Web3** — I develop decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum and Solana, bridging the gap between traditional web and blockchain technology.

→ **Solve Real Problems** — Whether it's an e-commerce platform, real-time chat application, or a DeFi protocol, I focus on building products that actually make a difference.
