  about: `
## Hey there! I'm Rajdeep 👋

I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** and **Blockchain Enthusiast** who loves turning complex problems into elegant, user-friendly solutions.

### What I Do

🚀 **Build Modern Web Apps** — From responsive frontends to robust backends, I craft seamless digital experiences using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

⛓️ **Explore Web3** — I develop decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum and Solana, bridging the gap between traditional web and blockchain technology.

💡 **Solve Real Problems** — Whether it's an e-commerce platform, real-time chat application, or a DeFi protocol, I focus on building products that actually make a difference.

### My Philosophy

I believe great software is a blend of **clean code**, **intuitive design**, and **scalable architecture**. I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and pushing my boundaries to stay ahead in this ever-evolving tech landscape.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.

*Let's build something amazing together!* ✨
